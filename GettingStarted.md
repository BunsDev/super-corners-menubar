## Getting Started Guide

### 1. Triggering Actions

- Trigger actions by holding the default activation hotkey (Control + Shift + Space) and moving your mouse toward a screen corner or the center of any screen edge.
- You can customize the hotkey and trigger sensitivity in the Settings Menu under "Behavior".
- **Note (as of v1.0.0)**: Actions are applied globally across all displays and cannot be configured per display. This means you can trigger any assigned action from any connected screen.

### 2. Assigning Actions

- To assign an action to a corner or zone, click the corresponding button in the either the Corner and Zone Tab in the main app. This will open the action picker.
- To assign an action from the action picker, click on an action and then click the done button. Thats it!

### 3. Using Template Actions

- Template actions are special actions that require additional input to function—such as launching an app, opening a file or folder, or running a shortcut.
- Assigning a template action is done the same way as a normal action. However, after clicking Done, you’ll be prompted to enter a required input (like a file path, website URL, or shortcut name).
- Each corner/zone stores its own input, so you can use the same action differently across the screen.

### 4. Menubar Component

- The Menubar Component offers a quick and alternative way to trigger actions assigned to each corner and zone.
- Each corner/zone has a corresponding button in the menu. Clicking a button triggers the assigned action instantly.
- After assigning or updating actions, click the Refresh button (or press Command + R) in the Menubar Component to update the displayed action titles.
- If your prefer, you can disable the Menubar Component from the "General" section in Settings Window.
