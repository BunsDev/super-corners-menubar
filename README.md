SuperCorners is a macOS app that takes your screen corners to the next level.

I've always loved the Hot Corners feature on macOS, but it's always felt very limited. So I built SuperCorners, which aims to provide a more polished and powerful experience. It builds on Apple's built in Hot Corners with extra trigger zones while providing more control and smarter automation, transforming each corner and zone into a powerful part of your productivity system.

## Features

- **Additional Zones** - Trigger actions when moving your mouse the middle of any screen edge.
- **Launch Apps** - Launch apps directly from corners and zones.
- **Run Shortcuts** - Run shortcuts directly from corners and zones.
- **Open Files and Folders** - Open Files and Folders directly from corners and zones.
- **Run Apple and Bash Scripts** - Run scripts directly from corners and zones.
- **Open Websites** - Open Websites directly from corners and zones.
- **In App Actions** - Trigger in app actions directly from corners and zones.
- **System Commands** - Run system commands directly from your screen corners and zones.
- **Tools** - Access useful tools from your screen corners and zones.
- **Developer Utilities** - Access useful developer related info directly from your screen corners and zones.
- **Menubar Component** - Access your corner and zone actions right from the menubar for instant control.
- **Visual Feedback** - Subtle toast notifications appear briefly to provide visual feedback for actions.
- **Configurable** - Disable any corner or zone and control app behaviors.
- **Native** - Built with Swift and SwiftUI for a seamless experience that feels well integrated with macOS.
