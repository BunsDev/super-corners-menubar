SuperCorners is a macOS app that takes your screen corners to the next level.

I've always loved the Hot Corners feature on macOS, but it's always felt very limited. So I built SuperCorner, which aims to provide a more polished and powerful experience. It builds on Apple's built in Hot Corners with extra trigger zones while providing more control and smarter automation, transforming each corner and zone into a powerful part of your productivity system.
