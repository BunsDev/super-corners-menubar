<!-- TODO: Add app Screenshot Here -->

SuperCorners is a macOS app that takes your screen corners to the next level.

I've always loved the Hot Corners feature on macOS, but it's always felt very limited. So I built SuperCorners, which aims to provide a more polished and powerful experience. It builds on Apple's built in Hot Corners with extra trigger zones while providing more control and smarter automation, transforming each corner and zone into a powerful part of your productivity system.

## Features

## Installation

**Requires macOS 13.0 and later**

1. Download the latest release
2. Move the app to your **Applications folder**
3. Run the app and grant necessary permissions when prompted

**Note**: On first launch, macOS may warn that the app couldn't be verified. Click **OK**, then go to **System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** to launch the app.
